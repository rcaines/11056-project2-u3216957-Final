**Website Experimentation**

**README**

  A Website designed as an experimentation with using ChatGPT in assisting in providing the needed code for completing what was wanted for the website.

**Requirements**
  
-  Html
-  CSS

**Roadmap**
  
  For the beginning of the website, I decided to test how different the chosen layout of a website ChatGPT would give me compared to the one I have learned.

  It was quite regular, but it missed a couple of key elements such as "dir=ltr" and "<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">".
  Following on, I began to look to experiment in ways of changing a website whereby I have seen it but would not entirely know how to achieve such a look.
  Starting with popup images in a grid with text below each of the individual images.

  From this, it worked when changing the image link from what was given, however, in adding text below the images was achievable to an extent.
  Whereby, in mobile platforms the text would be hidden under the image. The CSS had also not been written or understood by the AI that there would be text below each  image, but just an image grid.

  With the addition of hover popup text, the AI said it would require bootstrap or javascript elements to complete the task.
  This posed to be a problem for myself as I was not familiar with Javascript or bootstrap at all. Yet I still used what was given.
  Attempts were made in trying to fix the issue of the text, yet it would collide on either platform and it was decided to be removed.

**Alternate pathway to drop down text**

  For the final part to the website, I decided to make an "about section" as the website was then chosen to be a portfolio website with the layed out images and
  minimal text.

  For this, I used ChatGPT to create a circular border for the image. I wanted a 2px outline around the image, however, it did not work and I do not know why.
  I decided not to worry about the issue but more so considered my understanding of wanting a 2px border is around the square image and therefore I have already cut it
  off.

  Furthermore, I proceeded with completing the navbar, footer and logo of the website alongside with adding text to the above image grid.

**Problems**

- HoverText for image grid
- Circular border for image
- Bootstrap or Javascript elements

**Summary**

From this experimental website building exercise, it was found utilising an AI to assist in providing code has its pros and cons. One of which is if you understand
what you are coding and the attributing factors to why a certain application isn't working, you will be able to correct the mistakes provided by the computer.
